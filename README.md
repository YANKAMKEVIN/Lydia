# Lydia Technical Test Project

## Introduction
The objective of this technical test is to create an offline Contact Android Application displaying a list of contacts and their details when clicking on it, by using a network API.

---

## Test Instructions
Here are the instructions for the test:

### Mandatory Requirements:
- Use **Kotlin** as the programming language.
- Implement **dependency injection**.
- Data needs to come from this API using the last version of the API (1.3) [hrandomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/)
- Display a paginated list of contacts with an infinite scroll
- Display the details of a contact when clicking on it from the list.
- Add an offline mode and handle connectivity issues during the usage of the app.
- Ensure API calls support **pagination**.

### Areas of Focus:
- Application architecture.
- Use of **coroutines** for asynchronous operations.
- Utilization of **Jetpack libraries**.
- Writing and implementation of **unit tests**.

---

## My Approach
I will firstly focus on the implementing the api call, then the ui, next the pagination, details and then offline mode. 

---

## Implemented APIs

### 1. **RandomAPI** ([hrandomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/))
- Displays a **paginated list of random Contacts**.
- Clicking on a contact card provides access to its **detailed information**.
---

## Technical Highlights

### Language and Frameworks:
- Full **Kotlin** implementation.
- UI entirely built with **Jetpack Compose**.

### Dependency Injection:
- **Hilt** used for dependency injection.

### Networking:
- **Retrofit** implemented for API communication.

### Key Features:
- **Robust architecture** ensuring scalability and maintainability.
- Comprehensive **unit testing** for critical classes and functionalities.

This project is a demonstration of my ability to design, develop, and test complex Android applications while adhering to modern best practices.

Thank you for reviewing my work!
